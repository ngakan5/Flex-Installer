FLEXINSTALLER - ALL-IN-ONE INSTALLER v3.0
=========================================

STEP 1: CONFIGURE YOUR APP
- Edit Config.cs with your app details
- Set your Dropbox download URL  
- Customize messages, paths, and options

STEP 2: BUILD INSTALLER
- Run build.bat
- Enter output filename
- .exe file created in output\ folder

STEP 3: DISTRIBUTE
- Just share the .exe file!

DROPBOX SETUP:
1. Go to https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
2. Create new app
3. Upload your program file  
4. Get direct download link (replace "?dl=0" at the end with "?dl=1" to share URL)    !!!VERY IMPORTANT OR IT WONT WORK!!!
5. Put the URL into config

HOW IT WORKS:
- Single .exe contains both installer and uninstaller
- During installation, copies itself as "uninstall.exe"
- Windows Add/Remove Programs points to uninstall.exe
- When uninstall.exe runs it detects its an uninstaller and shows uninstall GUI
- Completely removes app, shortcuts registry entries, and itself
